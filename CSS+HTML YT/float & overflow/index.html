        The CSS float property is used to move an element out of the normal
        document flow and position it to the left or right of its container. For
        example, float: left moves the element to the left, and float: right
        moves it to the right. Other content will wrap around the floated
        element which helps to create a more dynamic layout. Although there's no
        direct float: center in CSS, you can use other methods like margins to
        center elements.
        <br />
        The float: right; CSS property positions an element on the right side of
        its container, allowing content to flow around its left side. The float:
        none; CSS property resets the floating behavior of an element, causing
        it to not float and remain in the normal document flow.
